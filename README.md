# Virtual-Reality-Project
We designed a virtual room, where the user can create and manipulate (rescale, move, delete) paitings using PICO VR-commands.
There are 3 special painting-types that activate when the user gets close to them: 
1) Sound paintings, that play music;
2) Spawn paintings, that spawn a virtual creature;
3) Skybox paintings, that change the skybox of the virtual room to match the landscape in the painting.
